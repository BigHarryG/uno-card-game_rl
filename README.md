# Tackling the UNO Card Game with Reinforcement Learning
In this project I tried to analytically derive an optimal strategy, for the classic UNO card game. To do so, I split up the workflow into 3 parts:
* Creating a game engine of the UNO card game in Python from scratch
* Obtaining game statistics from simulating a series of 100,000 games
* Implementing basic Reinforcement Learning techniques in order to discover an optimal game strategy
